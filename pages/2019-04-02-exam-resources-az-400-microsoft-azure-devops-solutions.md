Recently I successfully <a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/5b73e485-8234-4835-a79d-c050b8646470/public_url" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">passed</a> the Azure DevOps Solutions Associate exam.

I work with Azure on a daily basis (predominately in the Infrastructure space), and more recently I've been engaged in a large Azure project, in deploying a global enterprise environment all using Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC). In that project though, we are using Terraform and not ARM, and Terraform Enterprise, not Azure DevOps. However, the principles and concepts all apply (it's just the wording/naming for tools, features, etc. that change).

I wanted to briefly share the resources that I used to accomplish this. Here’s the list in no specific order:
<h2>OpenEdX Course</h2>
<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/OpenEdXMicrosoft-DevOps.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-32237" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/OpenEdXMicrosoft-DevOps-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" /></a>The <a style="font-size: 14px;" href="https://gregorsuttie.com/2018/10/27/azure-devops-az-400-exam-study-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exam study notes</a><span style="font-size: 14px; color: #1d1d1d;"> resource list posted by </span><a style="font-size: 14px;" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregor-suttie-6772228a/?originalSubdomain=uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gregor Suttie</a><span style="font-size: 14px; color: #1d1d1d;"> was one of the main resources I used!</span>

However, in his list, he has links to all the documentation, etc.

What I found most useful in the list of links he shares, was his recently updated link pointing to the Microsoft OpenEdX course: <a href="https://openedx.microsoft.com/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+AZ-400.1+2019_T1/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Implementing DevOps Development Processes  </a>

Suggestion: As you go through that specific course, take extra time on Module 3 "Implement &amp; Manage Build Infrastructure" as there are a lot of pipeline concepts you need to know/understand.

Note: This referenced OpenEdX course, is one of 7 different courses that complete the AZ-400 series. Here are the links to all of them for quick reference:

<h2>Microsoft Professional Program</h2>
<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MSProfessionalProgram-DevOps.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-32238" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MSProfessionalProgram-DevOps-300x95.png" alt="" width="300" height="95" /></a>The <a href="https://academy.microsoft.com/en-us/professional-program/tracks/devops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Professional Program (MPP) for DevOps</a> provides you with the opportunity to gain real-world experience by providing self-paced courses, demos, labs, and projects. It's long, and a lot to go through, but you'll be far more experienced and comfortable with the tools and techniques of Azure DevOps (even if you don't write or pass the exam).

&nbsp;
<h2>Hands-On Labs</h2>
<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/AzureDevOps-HandsOnLabs.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-32240" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/AzureDevOps-HandsOnLabs-300x151.png" alt="" width="300" height="151" /></a>Microsoft has also provided a series of <a href="https://www.azuredevopslabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure DevOps Hands-On Labs</a>.

There is no specific order to follow in these, either go through them in the order you want or focus on areas that you need more depth and experience with.

To get the most out of these labs, you are going to need an Azure DevOps account, and use the <a href="https://azuredevopsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure DevOps Demo Generator</a> to produce some pre-populated sample content.

&nbsp;

<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MS-Learn.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-32280" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MS-Learn-300x82.png" alt="" width="300" height="82" /></a>Another really good resource that I have discovered recently, is the Microsoft Learn site, specifically the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/learn/browse/?resource_type=learning%20path&amp;roles=devops-engineer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DevOps Engineer Learning Path</a>. This also uses the <a href="https://azuredevopsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure DevOps Demo Generator</a> as well, but I really like the story-telling guided approach. It takes you through a company's DevOps journey, without overwhelming you with everything you can do in Azure DevOps.

&nbsp;
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/AzureDevOps-Documentation.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-32242" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/AzureDevOps-Documentation-300x93.png" alt="" width="300" height="93" /></a>I know it goes without saying that you can always read the documentation, but the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/?view=azure-devops" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure DevOps Documentation</a> is a good place to also start. Whether you're new to DevOps, or just need to learn a specific component (i.e. Pipelines), there's lots of information to help you get started.

&nbsp;

I hope these reference, resources, and methodologies may be of some help to you as well.
