Recently I successfully <a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/939a6aa7-f05d-4ef0-8276-0b463d967955/public_url" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">passed</a> the Azure Fundamentals exam.

I work with Azure on a daily basis (predominately in the Infrastructure space), and because of this, I've gained sufficient experience with many Azure technologies to be able to pass the recent exams (see my <a href="http://adinermie.com/resources/exam-resources/">Exam Resources</a> page for the list).

Although my current experience level with Azure meant that I didn't have to explicitly prepare or study for this exam, I still wanted to share a few resources that others have shared that might be useful in your preparations. Here’s the list in no specific order:
<h1>Microsoft Learn</h1>
<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MS-Learn.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-32280" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MS-Learn-300x82.png" alt="" width="300" height="82" /></a>Microsoft Learn has an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure fundamentals</a> learning path, that includes modules that cover cloud concepts such as High Availability, Scalability, Elasticity, Agility, Fault Tolerance, and Disaster Recovery.

&nbsp;

I hope these reference, resources, and methodologies may be of some help to you as well. If you know of any other resources that you think should be included in this list, reach out, and I'll add it.
