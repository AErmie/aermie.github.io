Today I finalized the hardware that I will purchase for my new lab setup!

A few of the highlights include, a 6-core Intel Xeon processor, 64 GB of RAM, and a tower that can hold 14 HDD's!

Here is a link to the NewEgg.ca Wish List that details all of my parts:

I welcome anyone's opinion on the hardware selected.

Here are some pictures.
