The chapter(s) that I found most helpful were basically all of them! hence the majority of my highlights are from basically the entire book.

I’ve decided to share my highlights from reading this specific publication, in case the points that I found of note/interest will be of some benefit to someone else. So, here are my highlights (by chapter). Note that not every chapter will have highlights (depending on the content and the main focus of my work).

&nbsp;
<h3>Chapter 01: Introduction to Virtualization and Microsoft Solutions</h3>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>Many remote offices will deploy two virtualization servers with some kind of external storage enclosure that can be connected to both servers. This enables virtual machines to actually be moved between the servers, allowing high availability</li>
	<li>Virtualization also allows simpler backup and recovery processes by allowing backups to be taken of the entire virtual machine.</li>
	<li>Download Coreinfo from <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/cc835722.aspx" target="_blank">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/cc835722.aspx </a>and execute it with the -f switch. This will show which instruction sets are supported on your processor</li>
	<li>There is no real performance improvement of a generation 1 vs. generation 2 virtual machine once the OS is installed and running, but a generation 2 virtual machine will install and boot faster</li>
	<li>Extended Hyper-V Replica can be configured, allowing a replica to be created of a replica. Note that the extended replica is sourced from the existing replica and not from the original virtual machine. This is a useful capability for organizations using Hyper-V Replica within a datacenter that also want an additional replica in a separate datacenter for true DR.</li>

	<li>Activation can be a pain point in virtual environments. In Windows Server 2012 R2 Hyper-V, if the Hyper-V host is running Datacenter edition and is activated, then any Windows Server 2012 R2 virtual machine (Essentials, Standard, or Datacenter) on the server will automatically activate. No need for KMS or Active Directory Based Activation (ADBA). If the VM leaves the host, it will deactivate. The only required action is to use the Automatic Virtual Machine Activation key in the guest OS, which can be found at the following location:
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn303421.aspx" target="_blank">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn303421.aspx</a></li>
	<li>License mobility only allows the movement of licenses every 90 days, which means you could move the virtual machines and the licenses but you would not be able to move the virtual machines back for 90 days.</li>
	<li>Standard vs. Datacenter relates to the number of virtual instances running the Windows Server operating system. If you need to run something other than Windows Server, like Linux virtual machines or Windows Client virtual machines such as for a VDI environment, then these virtual instances do not apply and you need to license those operating systems to whatever licensing scheme is required. There is no limit to the number of virtual machines you can run on Windows Server Standard Hyper-V, and it would be possible to have hundreds of virtual machines running Linux or Windows Client without the need to use Datacenter or have multiple Standard licenses.</li>
	<li>One key feature of SCCM for servers is settings management, which allows a configuration of desired settings to be defined (such as OS and application settings) and then applied to a group of servers (or desktops). This can be useful for compliance requirements.</li>
	<li>The Microsoft mandate is that any Microsoft product should have a management pack that is written by the product team responsible for the application or operating system component. This means that all the knowledge of those developers, the people who create best practice documents, is incorporated into these management packs, which you can then just deploy to your environment.</li>
	<li>Just because you can back up at the Hyper-V level does not mean you should back up only at the Hyper-V level. If you want granular restoration capabilities of applications like SharePoint, SQL Server, and Exchange, you need to have the DPM agent installed within the virtual machine and actually be backing up from the VM directly to enable DPM to have the knowledge of the application configuration and data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Chapter 02: Virtual Machine Resource Fundamentals</h3>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>The Virtual Machine Management Service (VMMS) manages the state of virtual machines and launches the Virtual Machine Worker processes (VMWPs). There's one for each child partition running, and it controls the state changes of the child partition, enables certain types of emulated hardware, and enables management activities such as stopping and starting.</li>
	<li>The VMBus is not shared between all the child partitions, and there is one channel between each child and the parent so no communication or data can be seen by other child partitions running on the same server</li>
	<li>Each virtual machine believes it is the sole user of the hardware it is running on.</li>
	<li>Remember that the vmwp.exe runs in the user mode space of the parent partition, which means as emulated hardware is used, its performance will be poorer than the synthetic equivalents (which run purely in kernel mode and don't have the additional overhead of emulating physical pieces of hardware).</li>
	<li>Typically, you never want to use the legacy network adapter except for a very specific use case, booting over the network.</li>
	<li>Even if the virtual machine is in a different time zone or is part of a domain that synchronizes time from domain controllers, you should leave the time synchronization integration service enabled</li>
	<li>The recommendation is to just disable the time synchronization integration service completely, as documented in the time service section at the following location:
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/virtual_active_directory_domain_controller_virtualization_hyperv(WS.10).aspx" target="_blank">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/virtual_active_directory_domain_controller_virtualization_hyperv(WS.10).aspx</a></li>
	<li>There are two IDE controllers provided in a generation 1 virtual machine: IDE controller 0 and IDE controller 1. Each IDE controller can have up to two devices attached, which can be a hard drive or a DVD drive.</li>
	<li>In most virtual machines you will use the IDE controller only for the boot hard disk and all data drives will be connected to the synthetic SCSI controller instead.</li>
	<li>Each SCSI controller supports up to 64 hard drives attached, which equates to a maximum of 256 disks attached via the SCSI bus.</li>
	<li>Always use SCSI-connected disks where possible in the virtual machine and restrict use of IDE-connected disks to the operating system and DVD drive.</li>
	<li>Hyper-V does not allow the pass-through of a USB attached device on a host to a virtual machine. This would break the desired abstraction of the virtual machine from the hardware and therefore stop virtual machine mobility</li>
	<li>Secure Boot ensures a secure handoff from the UEFI to the operating system without any other party, such as malware, injecting itself between the hardware and the operating system.</li>
	<li>There are also no COM ports available via the Hyper-V Manager graphical interface. If a COM port is required in a generation 2 virtual machine for remote kernel debugging, then one can be added using the Set-VMComPort PowerShell cmdlet</li>
	<li>Remember also that kernel debugging is not compatible with Secure Boot, so if you need to perform kernel debugging (and many of us won't!), then turn of Secure Boot using Set-VMFirmware -EnableSecureBoot Off.</li>
	<li>There is also a performance improvement in the time to install an operating system and the time to boot an operating system for a generation 2 virtual machine compared to a generation 1 virtual machine, but once the virtual machine has been booted, there is no performance difference. The choice of generation 1 vs. generation 2 is made when the virtual machine is created and cannot be changed. A single Hyper-V server can have a mix of generation 1 and generation 2 virtual machines.</li>
	<li>A generation 1 virtual machine is BIOS based, which equates to a certain disk configuration such as an NTFS system partition. A generation 2 virtual machine is UEFI based and uses a FAT32 system partition. This alone prohibits moving virtual hard disks between generation 1 and generation 2 virtual machines.</li>
	<li>The only way to move from generation 1 to generation 2 is to boot the virtual machine from Windows PE, capture the partitions to a WIM file, then redeploy to a generation 2 virtual machine, but this amount of effort is really not worth the benefit, and generation 2 is best saved for new virtual machines.</li>
	<li>There is still only a single execution resource on the core, so hyperthreading does not double performance; the actual improvement varies, but between a 10 to 15 percent performance improvement is an accepted value.</li>
	<li>A single logical processor can be used by multiple virtual processors because the logical processors' capacity is divided up among the utilizing virtual processors as computations are required.</li>
	<li>You still cannot have more virtual processors in a virtual machine than logical processors that exist in the server</li>
	<li>Because of the fairly low additional performance hyperthreading actually yields, though, I prefer to count processor cores only when thinking about my virtual to physical ratios. If I have a Hyper-V host with 4 processor cores, I would consider 32 my maximum number of virtual processors, even if hyperthreading was enabled.</li>
	<li>The exact number of virtual processors supported for each guest operating system for Hyper-V is documented and updated at
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh831531.aspx" target="_blank">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh831531.aspx</a></li>
	<li>Solving “Hanging” Problems for Very Large Hyper-V Virtual Machines
For a virtual machine with more than 32 virtual processors, I would sometimes see the virtual machine hang within 30 seconds of logging on (the same time Server Manager started and used processor resources). After investigation, I found that the problem was basically that a large number of the logical processors in the Hyper-V host had gone into a C3 sleep state, which is a deep sleep state to save power when the processor is idle. The problem seemed to be caused by all these logical processors trying to wake at the same time and getting into contention with each other. The solution for me was to simply disable the C3 sleep state on my processors on the Hyper-V host using the following command:
reg.exe add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Processor /v Capabilities /t REG_DWORD /d 0x0007e066
Then I would reboot the server and my problem was solved.</li>
	<li>Windows Server 2012 introduced a new set of configurations for virtual machine processors, NUMA, but the reality is you should never touch these. Most likely bad things will happen and Hyper-V will make the right configurations for your environment without any manual intervention</li>
	<li>Consider a large Hyper-V environment with many different types of servers, with the physical servers having different NUMA topologies and where virtual machines may be live migrated between the servers. In this case, the NUMA configuration should be changed to match the smallest NUMA topology among all the servers to which the virtual machine may be migrated</li>
	<li>Note that if a virtual machine uses Dynamic Memory, the vNUMA is disabled for the virtual machine.</li>
	<li>Dynamic Memory is different from memory overcommit used by other hypervisors. Memory overcommit strategies tell the VM it has a very large amount of memory in the hopes that not all VMs try to write to all the visible memory</li>
	<li>The default Maximum RAM is 1,048,576 MB, the maximum Hyper-V allows</li>
	<li>The Enterprise SKU of SQL Server supports the hot-add of memory into the operating system, which is how SQL Server treats Dynamic Memory. That means for SQL Server to leverage additional memory, you must be running the Enterprise SKU of SQL Server. With SQL Server Enterprise edition, the physical memory is checked every second, and if the memory has increased, the target memory size for SQL Server is recalculated, which is how the additions from Dynamic Memory will be seen. Because SQL Server has its own caching mechanisms regarding free memory, the buffer percentage should be set to 5 percent for a SQL Server virtual machine instead of the default 20 percent.</li>
	<li>The Exchange 2010 and above Mailbox server role actually checks the amount of memory when the mailbox server starts and then does not recheck, so it will not take advantage of additional memory if it's added to the virtual machine after the mailbox service has started.</li>
	<li>Like SQL Server, Java also has its own caching mechanisms, which means the buffer percentage should be set to 5 percent for virtual machines running Java workloads instead of the default 20 percent.</li>
	<li>As soon as possible, that memory mapped to the Smart Paging file will be ballooned out and the Smart Paging file will be no longer used and deleted. The target time to stop using the Smart Paging file is as soon as possible and no longer than 10 minutes. The Smart Paging feature is only used to provide reliable restart of virtual machines and is not used to provide overcommit after boot.</li>
	<li>Always use virtual hard disks! While pass-through storage was required in some scenarios in Windows Server 2008 R2 Hyper-V, it really should never be needed with the new VHDX format</li>
	<li>Once a VHD becomes a parent disk, it becomes read-only. A differencing disk has a name of AVHD instead of VHD and will grow as data is written, behaving very similar to a dynamic disk.</li>
	<li>Although there is little performance difference between a dynamic and fixed VHD in Windows Server 2008 R2, the recommendation for production environments is to use a fixed VHD</li>
	<li>While the IDE bus must be used for DVD drives and the disk the virtual machine will boot from, for all other VHDs, the SCSI bus is recommended for best performance and maximum flexibility.</li>
	<li>VHDX supports a maximum virtual hard disk size of 64 TB, 32 times that of the VHD format</li>
	<li>VHDX files automatically align with the underlying physical structure of the disk, giving the most optimal performance, and also leverage larger block sizes for dynamic and differencing disk, giving better performance</li>
	<li>The conversion works by creating a new virtual hard disk and copying the content so it will consume extra space on disk during the conversion process and may take a long time.</li>
