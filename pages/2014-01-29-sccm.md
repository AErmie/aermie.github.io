For anyone that has followed my other posts and guides, you may be wondering why I don't have any Install and Config guides for System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM).

The reason is because I started to write these guides for a community site (<a href="http://www.windows-noob.com/" target="_blank">http://www.windows-noob.com/</a>). Originally, the community was looking for guides on SCOM, so that's where I started. However, since I specialize in the entire System Center suite of applications, and there were no Install and Config guides. So I wrote guides for each System Center product.

However, the owner of the Windows Noob site, specializes in SCCM, and has done a lot of work writing guides for that specific product. Therefore, it seemed redundant if I were to write my own install and config guides, when I was just learning off of him.

Hence, for any guidance on installing System Center Configuration Manager, I will point you to the following link: <a href="http://www.windows-noob.com/forums/index.php?/topic/4045-system-center-2012-configuration-manager-guides/" target="_blank">http://www.windows-noob.com/forums/index.php?/topic/4045-system-center-2012-configuration-manager-guides/</a>.

That all being said, since I am an IT Consultant I am engaged on various projects that use SCCM. Therefore I will use this space to post things that I encounter that may be of help.
