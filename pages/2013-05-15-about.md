<h2>My Personality</h2>
For those that know me personally, this won't come as a surprise. I recently took the <a href="https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clifton Strengths</a> test, and my top 5 strengths were:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Learner</strong> - People exceptionally talented in the Learner theme have a great desire to learn and want to continuously improve. The process of learning, rather than the outcome, excites them.</li>
 	<li><strong>Analytical</strong> - People exceptionally talented in the Analytical theme search for reasons and causes. They have the ability to think about all of the factors that might affect a situation.</li>
 	<li><strong>Input</strong> - <span class="c-strength-list__strength-description">People exceptionally talented in the Input theme have a need to collect and archive. They may accumulate information, ideas, artifacts or even relationships. </span></li>
 	<li><strong>Focus</strong> - People exceptionally talented in the Focus theme can take a direction, follow through and make the corrections necessary to stay on track. They prioritize, then act.</li>
 	<li><strong>Achiever</strong> - People exceptionally talented in the Achiever theme work hard and possess a great deal of stamina. They take immense satisfaction in being busy and productive.</li>
</ol>

I also took a <a href="https://www.mmsonline.com/columns/understanding-the-four-major-behavioral-styles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Behavioral Style</a> test, and my primary behavioral style is <strong>Expressive</strong>, and my secondary style is <strong>Analytic</strong>.
<blockquote><strong>Expressive-Analytics</strong> take factual information and sell ideas convincingly. They are competitive and accomplish goals through people. Maintaining high standards of personal performance is important. They tend to be direct but also considerate. One of their significant strengths is the ability to develop a detailed plan and then involve others in the implementation, decision making, and problem-solving. They often work with great intensity.</blockquote>
