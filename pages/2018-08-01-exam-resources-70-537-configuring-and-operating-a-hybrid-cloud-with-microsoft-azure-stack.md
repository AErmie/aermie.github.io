I wanted to briefly share the resources that I used to accomplish this. Here’s the list in no specific order:

<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MicrosoftHybridCloudWithAzureStackAndAzure_BookCover.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-30746" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MicrosoftHybridCloudWithAzureStackAndAzure_BookCover-229x300.jpg" alt="" width="229" height="300" /></a>Book: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Hybrid-Cloud-Unleashed-Azure/dp/0672338505" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Hybrid Cloud Unleashed With Azure Stack and Azure</a>.

This book has a ton of useful information, as is evident with my long list of highlights in my book review found <a href="http://adinermie.com/resources/technical-book-reviews/book-review-microsoft-hybrid-cloud-unleashed-azure-stack-azure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Microsoft-OpenEdX-AzureStackCourse.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-31316" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Microsoft-OpenEdX-AzureStackCourse-253x300.png" alt="" width="253" height="300" /></a>

Course: <a href="https://openedx.microsoft.com/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+INF240x+2018_T2/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Configuring and Operating Microsoft Azure Stack</a> via Microsoft OpenEdX

This course has a lot of information, and there is a lot of reading. But, what I really like about this course, is that there are assessments after each module, to gauge your understanding.

What's also of great value, is the hands-on online labs. Not everyone has the hardware in their home lab (or even at work) to support deploying/testing Azure Stack. The course provides hands-on experience via labs so that you can gain actual experience.

Even though this is just a PowerPoint presentation, it has lots of great links to additional information and resources.

I hope these reference, resources, and methodologies may be of some help to you as well.
