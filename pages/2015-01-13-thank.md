<h1>Thank You!</h1>
Thank you very much for donating to the ongoing operation of this website. We really appreciate your contributions.

Since we are just recently testing the donation feature, if you have any ideas about how to reward those that donate specifically, please send me an email via the <a title="About Me" href="http://adinermie.com/about/">About Me</a> page.

Thank you once again for your support. We look forward to continue to produce using guides and articles tailored to the needs of the community.
