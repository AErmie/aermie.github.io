In case you were not aware, MiCloud has its own <a title="MiCloud YouTube Channel" href="https://youtube.com/user/SCMiCloud/feed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel</a>!

I also have uploaded some of my presentation recordings as well, which is available here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AdinErmie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/c/AdinErmie</a>

For some articles (not all), videos will be recorded and made available online to assist those walking through the technology.

If you find an article on this site that does not have a video, and you would like one produced, then by all means contact me via my <a title="About Me" href="http://adinermie.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About Me</a> page and we will work on accommodating your request.

Thank you for your interest in the MiCloud website, and don't forget to comment, rate, subscribe/follow, and share our work with others in the community.
