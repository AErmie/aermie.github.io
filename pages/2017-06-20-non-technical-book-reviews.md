This page contains a list of what I consider non-technical books, whitepapers, etc. that I've read, and wanted to share the interesting points I've found within.

In my opinion, "technical" books are more topic-focused and deep-dive style, whereas "non-technical" are more high-level, conceptual, and general. Both serve a purpose, but I wanted to separate the two categories of content.
