For my System Center lab environment, I have a VM per System Center product.

However, to have everything working properly, you first need a Virtual Machine, a Domain, and a Database/Reporting Services.

To accomplish this, I am going to post some step-by-step guides for the standard elements required (VMs, SQL, AD, etc.). I will use these as the foundation, and then build product specific guides for installation, configuration, etc.

Here are the standard elements guides:

<a title="System Center 2012 SP1 in a LAB – Installation (Part A – Create The Lab Environment)" href="http://adinermie.com/lab-environment/system-center-2012-sp1-in-a-lab-installation-part-a-create-the-lab-environment/">System Center 2012 SP1 in a LAB – Installation (Part A – Create The Lab Environment)</a>

<a title="System Center 2012 SP1 in a LAB – Installation (Part B – Install the Operating System)" href="http://adinermie.com/lab-environment/system-center-2012-sp1-in-a-lab-installation-part-b-install-the-operating-system/">System Center 2012 SP1 in a LAB – Installation (Part B – Install the Operating System)</a>

<a title="System Center 2012 SP1 in a LAB – Installation (Part C – Install Active Directory Domain Services)" href="http://adinermie.com/lab-environment/system-center-2012-sp1-in-a-lab-installation-part-c-install-active-directory-domain-services/">System Center 2012 SP1 in a LAB – Installation (Part C – Install Active Directory Domain Services)</a>

<a title="System Center 2012 SP1 in a LAB – Installation (Part D – Install SQL Server)" href="http://adinermie.com/lab-environment/system-center-2012-sp1-in-a-lab-installation-part-d-install-sql-server/">System Center 2012 SP1 in a LAB – Installation (Part D – Install SQL Server)</a>

Use these guides as the starting point for all System Center Guides. Each product guide will then continue, with the assumption that these guides have been followed.

If there is any questions or feedback, please email me at Adin.Ermie@outlook.com.
