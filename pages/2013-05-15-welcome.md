Hello All,

I started this blog to document my new home lab setup, specifically dedicated to running my own Private Cloud lab.

Within my lab, I will be running each System Center 2012 product (Operations Manager, Configuration Manager, Virtual Machine Manager, Data Protection Manager, Orchestrator, Service Manager, and App Controller) on their own set of VMâ€™s.

I have a very specific plan that I will follow (and document), which I will detail at a later time.

But first, I would like to say welcome to all who are interested in following my efforts.

UPDATE: Hi everyone, since I have completed creating Installation and Configuration guides for most of the System Center products, I'm trying to decide what to focus on next.

Should I start on some deep-dives (i.e. with SCOM), or would the community perfer to see exam-based gudies (i.e. MCSE Private Cloud objective examples and walk-through)? Or is there something else?

I may post a poll with a few options, but I'm also looking for comments from the community on what everyone would like to see/find helpful.

UPDATE #2:

I have recently changed the look of the site, along with converting the pages into posts to make it easier to share.

What do you think? Do you like the changes?
