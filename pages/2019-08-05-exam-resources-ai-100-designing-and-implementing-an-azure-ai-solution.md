Recently I successfully <a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/1652f54f-2593-45e3-861c-cac21a675820/public_url" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">passed</a> the Designing and Implementing an Azure AI Solution exam.

Even though I work with Azure on a daily basis (predominately in the Infrastructure space), I don't currently do a lot of hands-on work with the Azure AI solutions (aka Cognitive Services). However, it is an area that I have an interest in, and have been reading up on lately. It's, for this reason, I decided to attempt the exam, to gauge where my current knowledge was.
