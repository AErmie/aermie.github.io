<p>Recently I successfully&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/74a351a8-9389-46de-a786-4406cd8493a3/public_url" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">passed</a>&nbsp;the Azure Administrator Associate exams (comprised of either the AZ-100 and AZ-101 or AZ-102). In fact, I wrote all three exams while they were in beta, and passed all three! I guess that makes me certified as an Azure Administrator twice over! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although I have already passed the 70-533 exam in the past, as of December 2018 all those previous 70-X exams are obsolete! So, we all have to write these new Azure exams, especially if our employers want to maintain their Gold/Silver partner <g class="gr_ gr_163 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="163" data-gr-id="163">compentencies</g>! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I work with Azure on a daily basis (predominately in the Infrastructure space), both in the hands-on delivery of projects and in solution architecting. So this exam gave me an opportunity to evaluate if my skills and experience are still current.</p>

<p>But, enough of my reflecting, on to the resources!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wanted to briefly share the resources that I used to accomplish this. Hereâ€™s the list in no specific order:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Study Groups</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":32110,"align":"left"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/AZ-100-StudyGroup-300x169.png" alt="" class="wp-image-32110"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Microsoft held some Study Groups for the individual exams. What I appreciate about these, is that they not only provide you with some reading material (which is just pointers to the official documentation), but also homework that includes hands-on experience (i.e. via Microsoft Learn, etc.).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are multiple study groups (one for each exam), which I will list/link to here for quick reference: </p>

<h2>Microsoft Cloud Society</h2>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/MSCloudSociety-232x300.png" alt="" class="wp-image-32108"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are also some other courses available, via the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Microsoft Cloud Society (opens in a new tab)" href="https://cloudsociety.fastlane.live/" target="_blank">Microsoft Cloud Society</a>. These courses are similar to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="OpenEdX (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.edx.org/course/?search_query=microsoft" target="_blank">OpenEdX</a> course structure/layout, where they are "open" for registration within certain cycle periods.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What I like about this approach, is that each exam (i.a. AZ-100) is broken down into sub-modules to make it easier to complete, and also to focus on the area(s) you may need more experience with.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You'll notice that I refer to these courses for the Azure Solution Architect exams as well.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pluralsight also offers several "paths" with multiple courses therein, for each of the Azure Administrator exams. I will also list/link to them here for quick reference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They do not yet have a path for the AZ-102 transition exam though. So if you're planning on writing the transition, you may have to pick and choose which courses from each path are most applicable. </p>

I hope these reference, resources, and methodologies may be of some help to you as well.
